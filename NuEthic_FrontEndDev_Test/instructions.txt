Hello Jon,

It was good to talk with you today. I would like you to do a HTML, CSS front end test for me. Take this image below and replicate it on you local computer. 

Please send me the file of your HMTL and CSS when you are done. Let me know how long it took you to do this front end development test.

Make this a desktop website. You can make this mobile responsive or explain in detail of how you would do it.

I look forward to hearing back from you.
